# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware

### My personal implementation of the Marlin firmware for my custom-board Creality Ender 3

## Implementation Notes

- Be sure to check the PID and sensor values for your specific thermistors
- SD support has just been fixed and may still be a little buggy
- USB serial support is still in progress
- Octoprint currently does not connect properly, in the process of being fixed
